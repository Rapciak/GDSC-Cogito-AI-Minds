# Global Data Science Challenge
## The grade-AI generation. Re-righting Education with data & AI
ðŸ“– Welcome to the 7th edition of the Global Data Science Challenge: The grade-AI generation! This year, the focus is on improving the analysis of data from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS). Participants will team up with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create AI agents capable of answering complex questions using real data. The challenge aims to enhance the understanding and usability of educational data, fostering creativity and innovation in the field of education. ðŸ“–
